Vineyard Health Monitoring with UAV-based Hyperspectral Sensors and Machine Learning
Overview
This repository contains the research project conducted at Cal Poly Pomona, bringing together expertise from the Aerospace, Plant Science, and Computer Science departments. The focus is on the development and validation of machine learning models for the early detection of powdery mildew in vineyards, utilizing custom datasets obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with hyperspectral sensors.

Goals
Collect and Process Hyperspectral Data Cubes

Use UAVs equipped with hyperspectral sensors to capture images in VNIR and SWIR wavelengths.
Develop scripts/tools to process hyperspectral data cubes obtained from vineyards.
Train Machine Learning Models

Train and validate machine learning models using custom datasets.
Leverage Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN for object detection and feature extraction.
Incorporate different vegetation indices (NDTI, PMI, NDWI) derived from hyperspectral data.
Integrate data from proximal sensors, including CM 1000 Chlorophyll Meter and water potential meter.
Validate Predictions with Remote and Proximal Sensor Data

Collect a diverse set of remote sensing, proximal sensor, and visual inspection data for model validation.
Compare the performance of Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN in object detection and feature extraction.
